# Maze-Solver
Fun JavaScript project that started out as a simpler ASCII maze solver and grew from there.  
See it in action here: http://coreyshuman.com/projects/mazesolver/

ASCII Maze Solver is a simple automated maze solver that works on mazes saved into any array. ASCII format is something like this:

```
+-s--+  
|# ##|  
|#  #|  
+--e-+  
```

Where s is the start location, e is the exit location, spaces are traversable path, and any other character is a wall.

Maze Solver II built on the idea, but now mazes are represented graphically using HTML tables. 
Maze Solver II also features a built-in maze builder as well as start/stop and reset commands, plus improved solving algorithm.
